<h1>Bio</h1>

<p>I&#39;m a Visual Communications Major minoring in Computer Science.  I plan on graduating from Eastern Washington University in 2016.  I&#39;ve been studying here for over four years.  I&#39;ve moved several times living in a military family across the United States including the territory Guam.  I now live in Cheney and have lived here since my parents&#39; retirement after 2011.  I hope to start a career in web design after graduation and work towards obtaining Cisco Networking certifications to also work with networking.    </p>
